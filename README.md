# Project-3
# Budget & Expense Manager

A Python-first command-line and web-based budgeting tool.  
This project was built as **Portfolio Project 3 (Python Essentials)** for Code Institute, using the [python-essentials-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template).  

The application allows users to set monthly budgets, log expenses/income, view transaction history, and generate reports with forecasts â€” all managed by Python, with a simple interactive web page for ease of use.
